# Duck Hunt

[Duck Hunt](https://duck--hunt.herokuapp.com/login) is a Product Hunt clone utilized as a platform for duck enthusiasts. Used to post pictures of your favorite ducks or duck related gifs and interact with other users in the discussion section of individual posts.

## How to use
The landing page of duck hunt will allow you to log in or sign up. You can also utilize the demo login button for easy access to Duck Hunt. Once your logged in you will see a feed consisting of all posts ordered by newest posts. While hovering over posts in the main feed, posts that are owned by your current user will have an icon that looks like three dots to the right of the post name. This icon when clicked presents you with the ability to either delete or edit the post. You can also click on any post to open the post modal which will give you access to the post modal, which shows you the name of the duck, the description of the duck, and the discussion section of the duck. When viewing the post modal hovering over comments in the discussion section will present you with the same three dots icon that is present on posts that you own in the main feed. It will once again present you with the option to edit or delete your comment. In the top right of the screen you will see a button that says "New Post" and your own user's profile picture. The "New Post" button when clicked will open a modal which contains a form to add a new post to the feed, prompting you for a duck name, description and media file(image or gif). Once the form is submitted your post will appear at the top of the feed on the home page. When hovering over the profile picture in the top right a drop down will appear with an option that reads "Logout" and when clicked will log out your user and take you back to the login landing page.
